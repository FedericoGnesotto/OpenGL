# OpenGL
An open-gl wrapping library (LiBOpenGL) and different projects (Projects) linking and using this library.
External dependencies are needed and should be placed in an `externals/` subdirectory:
  - glfw
  - glad
  - glm
The stb library is also needed for one project, the src (stb_image.cpp, stdb_image_write.cpp) should be place under LibOpenGL/src/stb and the headers should be placed under include/std/. See here for details [https://github.com/nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
