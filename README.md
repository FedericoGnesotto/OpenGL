# OpenGL
An open-gl wrapping library (LinOpenGL) and different projects linking and using this library.
External dependencies are needed and should be placed in an `externals/` subdirectory:
  - glfw
  - glad
  - glm
The stb library is also needed for one project, the src (stb_image.cpp) should be place under LibOpenGL/src/stb and the header (stb.h) should be placed under include/std/stb_image.h
